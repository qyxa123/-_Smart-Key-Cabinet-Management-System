# Computer Principles Course Assignment 1: Smart Key Cabinet Interface Design & Team Collaboration

**Due Date:** 2025-10-29 23:59
**Submission Method:** Submit **Gitee repository link** and **project report (PDF format)** to the course learning platform.



### **1. Assignment Objectives**

This assignment aims to help you master the following core skills through a complete "design-development-collaboration" process:

1. **Version Control Fundamentals:** Become proficient with basic Git commands and learn to use Gitee for code hosting.
2. **Team Collaboration Practice:** Experience real team development workflows on Gitee and understand the importance of version management in collaboration.
3. **Interface Design Thinking:** Design user-friendly and logically clear borrowing/returning interfaces for a "Smart Key Cabinet" system based on real-life observations.
4. **Front-end Technology Application:** Use learned HTML and CSS knowledge to implement your designs as actual webpages, with practical form usage.



### **2. Assignment Content & Requirements**

**Project Theme: Smart Key Cabinet Borrowing/Returning System Interface Development**

Work in teams to design and implement a webpage interface for managing key borrowing and returning. The system should include at least two interfaces:

*   **Main Interface:** 
*   **Sub-interface:**

**Detailed Requirements:**

**Part 1: Git & Gitee Team Collaboration (30% of grade)**

1.  **Repository Creation & Management:**
    *   The team leader must create a public repository on Gitee and add all team members as collaborators.
    *   The repository must have a clear `README.md` file describing the project purpose, team member roles, and setup/run instructions.
2.  **Collaboration Process Demonstration:**
    *   Each member **must** create their own feature branch for development. **Direct commits** to the `main` or `master` branch are prohibited.
    *   Code must be merged into the main branch via **Pull Requests**, requiring **code review** by at least one other team member.
3.  **Workload Visibility:**
    *   Final grading will **heavily reference the Gitee repository's "Contribution Graph"** and **commit history**. Each member's commit activity should reflect their participation level.

**Part 2: Interface Design & Implementation (70% of grade)**

1.  **Design Rationality:**
    *   **Process Logic:** The borrowing/returning process must follow logical real-world steps (e.g., requiring borrower information when borrowing, confirmation when returning).
    *   **Usability:** Clear layout and navigation that allows users to complete operations without guidance.
    *   **Color Scheme & Aesthetics:** Choose a harmonious, professional color palette with an overall clean and visually appealing interface.
2.  **Front-end Implementation:**
    *   Use **HTML** and **CSS** for all page layout and styling.
    *   **Must include two or more different types of form controls**, such as: text inputs, dropdown selects, radio buttons, checkboxes, buttons, etc., to handle borrowing/returning information input.
    *   Pages should be navigable via hyperlinks.



### **3. Deliverables**

Submit the following before the deadline:

1.  **Gitee Repository Link:** Direct link to your team's project homepage.
2.  **Project Report (PDF Format):**
    *   **Cover Page:** Course name, assignment number, project name, team members and student IDs.
    *   **Work Division:** Detailed description of each member's specific contributions (Git collaboration, interface design, HTML/CSS coding, etc.).
    *   **Design Rationale:** Explain your interface design concept, reasons for choosing your color scheme, and the logic behind your borrowing/returning workflow.
    *   **Gitee Collaboration Screenshots:** Provide screenshots as evidence of your collaboration process (e.g., contribution graph, network graph, pull request list).
    *   **Final Results Screenshots:** Include screenshots of the final webpages.



### **4. Guidelines for Using AI Assistance**

We encourage exploration and use of new technologies. For this assignment, you may use AI tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT) for assistance.

*   **Permitted Use Cases:** Generating code skeletons, answering technical questions, providing color scheme suggestions, optimizing code structure, etc.
*   **Important Principles:**
    *   **Understand & Digest:** You must understand and be able to explain every line of AI-generated code and every suggestion to your instructor.
    *   **No Direct Copy-Pasting:** Submitting complete AI-generated solutions without modification is strictly prohibited.
    *   **Declaration in Report:** Briefly mention in your project report which AI tools were used and for which specific tasks (e.g., "Used ChatGPT to help generate initial CSS Flexbox layout code").

**Academic Integrity Reminder:** Misuse of AI tools resulting in code similarity or failure to demonstrate individual learning will negatively impact your grade.



### **5. Grading Criteria**

| Criteria | Description | Weight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Git Collaboration (30%)** | Proper Gitee repository management, clear branching model, active commit history, contribution graph shows full team participation. | 30% |
| **Interface Design (30%)** | Logical workflow, aesthetically pleasing and usable interface, coordinated color scheme, creative design. | 30% |
| **Technical Implementation (30%)** | Clean HTML/CSS code, meets technical requirements (including 2+ form controls), correct page linking. | 30% |
| **Project Report (10%)** | Well-structured report, clear work division, thorough explanations, sufficient supporting screenshots. | 10% |

Wishing you all successful collaboration and productive learning!
